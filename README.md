# 16SrRNABullSemen
The objective of this study was to characterize the microbiome of Bos taurus semen samples using 16S rRNA sequencing techniques. Semen was collected during a routine breeding soundness exam. Bacterial DNA was then extracted from sperm cells and sequenced. 16S rRNA sequences were filtered and analyzed using Qiime2 and R. Notable genera that were found within bull semen samples included Bacteroides, Escherichia-Shigella, Gemella, and uncultured bacteria. According to our samples, there were no significant differences in alpha or beta diversity measures when comparing satisfactory (greater or equal to 70% normal sperm) and unsatisfactory (less than 70% normal sperm) bulls (p < 0.05). Co-occurrence analysis showed that Methanobrevibacter was significantly integrated with other members of the seminal community (p < 0.05). Opportunistic pathogens such as Campylobacter and Fusobacterium were more well incorporated in the network of unsatisfactory bulls. Our analysis showed that the main effect of age nor breed did not provide any interesting findings but taxonomic differences were seen between bulls from different farms . This work may provide insight to the fertility and reproductive health of the bull.
